## About Me

I'm Furkan (23), working on private repositories.

I am a software developer with 6 years of software experience and 2 years of Android development experience with Kotlin. My passion for my job allows me to learn new things every day and work with the most up-to-date technologies. Android development is not just a job for me, it's an art and a way of life.

While I am excited about taking part in big projects, it is also important for me to guide beginners and share knowledge. My goal is to become a Master Expert in Android development and to constantly improve myself on this path.

Understanding the complex needs of the business world and providing user-friendly solutions is not just a duty but also a passion for me. In every project, I work to make users' lives easier and add value to the business world.

Specialties: Kotlin, Android
Kotlin ❤️ Me
